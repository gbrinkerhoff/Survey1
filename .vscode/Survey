# Summary: A program to help check in trucks, move them in a labeled yard system,
#       and change the load status while in a dock.
# Variables:
#   trailerNumber: the inbound trailer number that the gate agent will input
#   carrierName: the inbound trailers carrier
#   driverName: name of driver bringing in trailer
#   truckPlate: trucks liscense plate
#   trailerPlate: trailer liscense plate
#   sealNumber: seal on the back of the trailer, will only be used if trailers
#       loadStatus is set to loaded
#   loadStatus: current state of trailer fullness 
#   yardSpot: the number correlated to the spot in the yard
#   yardMove: if the person wants to move the trailer
#   loadChange: if a person wants to change the load status of a trailer
#   ops: the operation the person wants to run in the program
